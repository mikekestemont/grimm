- Baselines:
  - linear SVM, char 3-grams
  - burrow's delta with cosine similarity
  - NN + BoW (eventually)

* Taking into account HTR, OCR cleanliness scores

** Correlation analysis between doc-cleanliness and different classifiers

* Expectations

- Multihead-RNN performs better than all the baselines in all three categories
- Lower correlation with cleanliness than baselines

* Data preparation

** Default splits
